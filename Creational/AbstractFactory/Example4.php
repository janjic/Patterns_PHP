/**
 * The goal here, is to create a factory (the abstract factory), which creates product factories (in the example below
 * these are output types). The product factories then create the actual products (below these are the pretty and ugly
 * output type classes). Each product factory class has multiple methods for creating different class instances.
 * Rules
     * Each product factory must extend the same abstract class or implement the same interface.
     * Each product factory must have multiple methods, one for each class it wants to initialise.
     * Each product factory class you create must have the same methods. The same methods in each factory must return
     * polymorphic class instances and implement the same interface . If this is still unclear, the example should clear
     * things up.
 *
 * Advantages
     * Hides product classes from the client/controller, which helps to remove dependencies.
     * All product classes are made to be polymorphic, thus interchangable.
     * It promote consistency among products, all products should be grouped by the product factories
 *
 * Drawbacks
     * When adding a new product class, the abstract factory would need updating, this violates the Interface Segregation principle.
     * Youâ€™ll be hard pushed to find someone who actually gives a damn.
